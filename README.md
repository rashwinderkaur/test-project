Surround AI is the python framework which is designed for flexible usage in Artificial Intelligence(AI). It is designed to support data scientist in their progress. Each and every scientist use different algorithm to solve different problems. There are no standard way for them to analyse altogether in a single module. To provide a standard solution surround frame work is built. Evolution of machine learning pipeline is not possible without re-constructing the coding whereas surround package will provide a pipeline without any alterations.
# Usage

**#** Helping the data scientists in analytics instead of using glue codes for their research.

**#** Easy interaction between several machine learning pipelines.

**#** Provides end-to-end solution instead of providing solution for the models.

##  Current
Using cloud API for the upcoming training model.

Developing a pipeline for the system using algorithms of machine learning.
## Switch to another file

All your files are listed in the file explorer. You can switch from one to another by clicking a file in the list.

## Aim

To identify the drivers who are breaking the road rules with the help of AI(Artificial Intelligence).
**(Note: The system pipeline for this app is strictly under development.)**


## Method

**#** Taking the photo of the car on the mobile application

**#** Storing the image for the process.

**#** Sending the notification to the authorities API (note: Check the availability of the access to API)

**#** Integrating with AWSâ€™s recognition API for reading car number plates.

**#** Again notifies the Authorities for the infringement notice.

## Installation guide:

**Windows:**

**#** Clone the surround repository.

**#** Install python 3.6.5.

**#** Set path in Environment variables for python 3.6.5.

**#** Type !pip3 install surround in command prompt to install surround in your system.


## Conclusion:

Surround is under development which as goals to satisfy the needs of data scientists. It completely turns the view of analysing in machine learning and other concepts of AI(Artificial Intelligence).
